## Overview

This is a small mod which allows the generation of Skyblock worlds while preserving biomes. The player spawnpoint as well as the dimensions which should be replaced with a void world can be configured in the `skyblockgen.json` config.

## How it works

To create a skyblock world in singleplayer, you have to set the world type to "Skyblock" in the world creation menu.
On servers you have to set `level-type=skyblockgen:skyblock`.
